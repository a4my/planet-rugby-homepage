# planet-rugby 🏈

This repository contains the files of the very first project I have ever built alone and it is about one of my many passions: rugby! 😁

This fictional rugby webzine is also a multi-page website.

## What I used 🔨
My goal with this project was to build my own project from scratch to practice HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript.

## Extra learning ✔
I also wanted to practice some of the common basics and fundamentals of HTML and CSS such as animations, tables, glassmorphism, grid layout, flexbox, carousel, video integration, video sliders, contact forms

## Responsiveness 📱
This project is responsive on any device screens.
